    desc Prerequisites: Placement and two units of college-preparatory
    desc mathematics; if a student has previously been placed in MATH 005, a
    desc grade of "C-" or higher in MATH 005 is required. Intermediate-level
    desc course including work on functions, graphs, linear equations and
    desc inequalities, quadratic equations, systems of equations, and operations
    desc with exponents and radicals. The solution of word problems is stressed.

    name Precalculus Algebra
    desc A higher-level course emphasizing functions including polynomial
    desc functions, rational functions, and the exponential and logarithmic
    desc functions. Graphs of these functions are stressed. The course also
    desc includes work on equations, inequalities, systems of equations, the
    desc binomial theorem, and the complex and rational roots of polynomials.
    desc Applications are stressed. Grades are reported as A, B, C or NC (No
    desc Credit). Degree credit will not be granted for both MATH 115 and (MATH
    desc 112 or MATH 113).

    name Calculus I
    desc This is the first of three courses in the basic calculus sequence.
    desc Topics include the limit of a function; the derivative of algebraic,
    desc trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions; and the definite
    desc integral. Applications of the derivative are covered in detail,
    desc including approximations of error using differentials, maxima and
    desc minima problems, and curve sketching using calculus. There is also a
    desc brief review of selected precalculus topics at the beginning of the
    desc course. Degree credit will not be granted for both MATH 121 and MATH
    desc 125 or MATH 145.

    name Honors Calculus I
    desc This course covers the same material as MATH 125 but in a depth
    desc appropriate for honors students. It is the first course in the three
    desc part honors calculus sequence for students majoring in mathematics,
    desc science or engineering. Topics include limits, continuity,
    desc differentiation, applications of differentiation, and integration.
    desc Applications of the derivative are covered in detail, including
    desc approximation of errors using differentials, maxima and minima
    desc problems, curve sketching, optimization problems, and Newtonâ€™s method.
    desc Topics on integration include Riemann sums, properties of definite
    desc integrals, integration by substitution and integrals involving
    desc logarithmic exponential and trigonometric functions.
