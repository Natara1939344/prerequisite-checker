# Example data files.
**NOTE: the example plans in these data files do not necessarily represent sane or even humanly possible plans**

**!!THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THESE DATA FILES IS TO TEST THE PROGRAM!!**

Any people represented in these plans are entirely fictional.
The course-data used is from the 2021-2022 University of Alabama Course Catalog and what courses the University of Alabama
accepts as AP credits. This prerequisite-checker is not made by the University of Alabama. I personally would not necessarily
recommend attempting some of the more ambitious course pathways, which include attaining a master's in CS and Computer Engineering in four years
*and* graduating with honors. This is not reasonable as it *requires* some semesters to have around **thirty hours a week of committment**. This
is not physically possible as you would need to be in two places at the same time to attend certain classes.
