 Checks College Prerequisites

## Why prerequisite-checker?

 It all started in the fall of my freshman year at the University of Alabama: there seemingly was no system that automatically checks prequisites for your courses! Fortunately, 
 all necessary information exists online in the Course Catalog, however, checking these requisites manually is a pain. So, I made a program to do it. 

 **Technically**, this is the second version of prerequisite-checker, the first version seemed to messy to make open source.

## Can I use prerequisite-checker?

 Yes, prerequisite-checker uses the MIT license. I am not a lawyer (instead, I'm a Computer Engineering student), but the MIT license seems quite clear on its use and its terms.
 
 If you feel the need to read the license, it is available in the `LICENSE` file of this source code. Also, it is compiled into the executable and passing it with the argument 
 `--license` will output the license text and exit.
