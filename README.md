# Prerequisite Checker

Prerequisite checker is an open source software that helps check if a college
schedule is sane. That is, Prerequisite Checker will make sure the plan you
have for your class schedule does not put something like CS 200 before CS 101
(if that is not allowed).

## License

Prerequisite checker is published under the MIT license. You are free to use
the software in accordance with the terms of the MIT license.

## Disclaimer

Prerequisite checker cannot, will not, and should not replace a person or 
whatever entity performs the final check on your schedule. Since Prerequisite
checker is not made by your class schedule-approving software / team, 
Prerequisite checker *may give incorrect answers* and should never have the
final say in whether you should sign up for a course. Below are some intended
use cases for Prerequisite Checker. 

Good use cases:

1. College student who makes sure they have schedules which work and use
Prerequisite checker to avoid simple mistakes since a computer will not miss
that CS 200 does not allow MATH 238 to be taken concurrently.
2. A College advisor who wants to more quickly go through their work by having
Prerequisite checker perform an initial pass on the schedules they receive.

Bad use cases:

1. Using Prerequisite Checker to determine if you should take a class
2. Using Prerequisite Checker to argue with someone.
3. Signing up for a class just because Prerequisite Checker said you could 
(and for no other good reason).
4. NOT signing up for a class just because Prerequisite Checker said you
could not sign up for it (and for no other good reason).
